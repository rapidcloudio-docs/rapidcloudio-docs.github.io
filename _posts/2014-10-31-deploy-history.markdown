You can review your previous, current and pending deployments by going to the Deploy History page. One this page you'll see a list of your recent Deployments with an option to view the log detail page.

Your log details group by internal task (Pull Request, etc). If your deployment is still ongoing the page will update automatically as log data becomes available.
