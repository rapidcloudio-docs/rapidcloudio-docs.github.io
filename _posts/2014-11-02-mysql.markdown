summary: An overview of how to use MySQL with your application as well as how to login and administer the database yourself.
---
If you choose to install MySQL on your server, the database credentials are automatically provided as environment variables to your application. The variables are:

{% highlight bash %}
DB_NAME=local database name
DB_USER=local database login username
DB_PASSWORD=local database login password
DB_URL=local database jdbc url
{% endhighlight %}

## Logging into MySQL
Rapidcloud creates an administration account for you to use with the username rc-user (the password is emailed to you as part of your server setup). For security purposes remote access to MySQL is severely limited (by default only network members can connect). 

In order to access your database remotely you'll need to [ssh into your server]({% post_url 2014-10-31-ssh-into-server %}), then use your rc-user database login to access the database.

From your server, you can execute the following command to login
{% highlight bash %}
$ mysql -urc-user -p
{% endhighlight %}

Conveniently MySQL workbench supports logging in over ssh
