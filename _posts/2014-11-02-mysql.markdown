summary: An overview of how to use MySQL with your application as well as how to login and administer the database yourself.

If you choose to install MySQL on your server, the database credentials are automatically provided as environment variables to your application. The variables are:

{% highlight java %}
DB_NAME=local database name
DB_USER=local database login username
DB_PASSWORD=local database login password
DB_URL=local database jdbc url
{% endhighlight %}

## Logging into MySQL
Rapidcloud creates an administration account for you to use with the username rc-user. The password for that account is emailed to you as part of your server setup. To access your database remotely you'll need to [ssh into your machine]({% post_url 2014-10-31-ssh-into-server %}), then use the rc-user database login to access the database.

From your server, you can do the following to login:
{% highlight java %}
$ mysql -urc-user -p
{% endhighlight %}

Conveniently MySQL workbench supports logging in over ssh
