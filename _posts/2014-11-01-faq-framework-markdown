Rapidcloud.io supports the management and deployment of Play! 2 Web applications (built with sbt) or Java web applications packaged into a war file with Maven. Play applications are launched from the command line while Maven projects have their war filed deployed to Tomcat.


## Play

The default build for Play applications
<code>sbt clean compile stage -Dsbt.log.noformat=true</code>

## Maven (Tomcat)

The default build for Maven applications
<code>mvn clean package</code>

The output from this command must produce a war file, otherwise rapidcloud.io will mark the deployment as failed.
